  "name": "Vienna Lager",
  "overallImpression": "A moderate-strength continental amber lager with a soft, smooth maltiness and a balanced, moderate bitterness, yet finishing relatively dry. The malt flavor is clean, bready-rich, and somewhat toasty, with an elegant impression derived from quality base malts and process, not specialty malts or adjuncts.",
  "aroma": "Moderately-intense malt aroma, with toasty and malty-rich accents. A low floral, spicy hop aroma is optional. Clean lager character. A significant caramel, biscuity, or roasted aroma is inappropriate.",
  "appearance": "Light reddish amber to copper color. Bright clarity. Large, off-white, persistent head.",
  "flavor": "Soft, elegant malt complexity is in the forefront, with a firm enough hop bitterness to provide a balanced finish. The malt flavor tends towards a rich, toasty character, without significant caramel, biscuity, or roast flavors. Fairly dry, soft finish, with both rich malt and hop bitterness present in the aftertaste. A low floral, spicy, or herbal hop flavor is optional. Clean fermentation profile.",
  "mouthfeel": "Medium-light to medium body, with a gentle creaminess. Moderate carbonation. Smooth.",
  "comments": "A standard-strength everyday beer, not a beer brewed for festivals. Many traditional examples have become sweeter and more adjunct-laden, now seeming more like International Amber or Dark Lagers.",
  "history": "Developed by Anton Dreher in Vienna in 1841, became popular in the mid-late 1800s. The style was brought to Mexico by Santiago Graf and other Austrian immigrant brewers in the late 1800s. Seems to be embraced as a modern craft style in other countries.",
  "characteristicIngredients": "Traditionally, best-quality Vienna malt, but can also use Pils and Munich malts. Traditional continental hops. Clean German lager yeast. May use small amounts of specialty malts for color and sweetness.",
  "styleComparison": "Similar malt flavor as a Märzen, but lighter in intensity, and body, with a touch more bitterness and dryness in the balance. Lower in alcohol than Märzen or Festbier. Less rich, malty, and hoppy than Czech Amber Lager.",
