  "category": "21",
  "subcategory": "B",
  "name": "Specialty IPA",
  "overallImpression": "Recognizable as an IPA by balance – a hop-forward, bitter, dryish beer – with something else present to distinguish it from the standard categories. Should have good drinkability, regardless of the form. Excessive harshness and heaviness are typically faults, as are strong flavor clashes between the hops and the other specialty ingredients.",
  "aroma": "Detectable hop aroma is required; characterization of hops is dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA. Other aromatics may be present; hop aroma is typically the strongest element.",
  "appearance": "Color depends on specific type of Specialty IPA. Most should be clear, but a slight haze is acceptable in most styles. Darker types can be opaque, making clarity irrelevant. Good, persistent head stand with color dependent on the specific type of Specialty IPA.",
  "flavor": "Variable by type, with the quality of each component dependent on the specific Specialty IPA. Hop flavor typically medium-low to high. Hop bitterness typically medium-high to very high. Malt flavor generally low to medium. Commonly has BJCP Beer Style Guidelines – 2021 Edition a medium-dry to dry finish. Some clean alcohol flavor can be noted in stronger versions. Various types of Specialty IPAs can show additional malt and yeast characteristics, depending on the type.",
  "mouthfeel": "Smooth. Medium-light to medium body. Medium carbonation, generally. A background alcohol warmth can be perceived in stronger versions.",
  "comments": "Entrants may use this category for a different strength version of an IPA defined by its own BJCP subcategory (e.g., session-strength American or English IPA) – except where an existing BJCP subcategory already exists for that style (e.g., double [American] IPA). A Session IPA is a 21B Specialty IPA with a base style of 21A American IPA with Session strength. A Double IPA is Category 22A not 21B.",
  "history": "A relatively modern style, dating from the mid2000s. Homebrewers and craft breweries substituted Belgian yeast in their American IPA recipes. Belgian breweries typically added more hops to their stronger pale beers.",
  "characteristicIngredients": "Belgian yeast strains used in making Belgian Tripels and Golden Strong Ales. American examples tend to use American or New World hops while Belgian versions tend to use European hops and only pale malt. Sugar adjuncts common.",
  "styleComparison": "A cross between an American IPA or Double IPA with a Belgian Golden Strong Ale or Belgian Tripel. This style is may be spicier, stronger, drier, and fruitier than an American IPA.",
  "entryInstructions": "Entrant must specify a strength (session, standard, double); if no strength is specified, standard will be assumed. Entrant must specify specific type of Specialty IPA from the list of Currently Defined Types identified in the Style Guidelines, or as amended by Provisional Styles on the BJCP website; OR the entrant must describe the type of Specialty IPA and its key characteristics in comment form so judges will know what to expect. Entrants may specify specific hop varieties used, if entrants feel that judges may not recognize the varietal characteristics of newer hops. Entrants may specify a combination of defined IPA types (e.g., Black Rye IPA) without providing additional descriptions. Currently Defined Types: Belgian IPA, Black IPA, Brown IPA, Red IPA, Rye IPA, White IPA, Brut IPA",
